    # might work on other machines by specifying other locations for the
    # @bats glob and INFO filehandle? it could also be used for other
    # things by changing the reporting command, but other wms tend to
    # already have battery widgets.
    
    # v2 - handles multiple batteries, is more compactly written
    # v3 - "daemon", verbose modes. low-battery warning.
    
    # usage: ppcpmumon     report battery status
    #        ppcpmumon -d  'daemon' mode - run in loop, reporting only when
    #                      low battery threshhold is reached
    #        ppcpmumon -v  force reporting of battery status (only useful to
    #                      make daemon mode talk all the time
    #
    # i keep it bound to 'B' for ad hoc checking
