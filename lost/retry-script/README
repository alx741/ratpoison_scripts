Gnome-session equivalent.

Here are some one-liners to restart programs. They have been tested with bash and POSIX sh (dash).

doforever.sh dountil.sh xdoforever.sh xdountil.sh

(FIXME: Unfortunately these links doesn't seem to exist any more (404). Does anyone have alternative links to these scripts? A Readme in the root directory says they are moved to http://twb.ath.cx/~twb/src/, but I can not find them there either.)

The latter pair use XDialog to make a popup window.

Notes:

    exec prevents the buildup of wrapper processes.
    sleep relaxes hysterisis with e.g. /bin/false.
    Xdialog can be replaced with Zenity or GDialog. Gdialog seems to be the fastest.

Here are (faster?) versions that are unsafe if the command fails instantly, such as /bin/false.

    $@ && exec $0 $@    #Always restart.
    $@ || exec $0 $@    #Restart if cmd fails.
