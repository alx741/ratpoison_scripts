Expos equivalent (improved rpshowall).

Perl script which tiles all open windows next to each other and allows to select one of them. Think OS X's expos√©.

Todo:

    Update to use current fdump format.
    Rewrite in CL or scsh.

Script: expose.pl

    Due to e-mail obfuscation, line 46 should be:

    my $ret = join(", ", &rp_split(\@xids, \&split, $n, \@r));

    instead of what's on the file. -- [[buu?]]
