find and browse files in your hd with ratmenus

http://raimonster.googlepages.com/rat-finder.pl

Creates a database with your files (~/ default) when you input 'gen' as extension.

Browses your db and shows a ratmen with all files having desired pattern and extension. The first time an extension is given, asks for an app to open files with.

Please comment, and if you edit it, paste the code here :). Should I put the complete code here in the wiki? (~200 lines)

This script is a must-use!!! Nbx-cmD
