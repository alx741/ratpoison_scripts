Ratpoison virtual desktops: Manages groups and frame layouts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 update: Tue Jun 26 11:56:56 EDT 2012
 this script suffers from "bashisms" apparently due to the /bin/sh (dash)
 replacement that has occured in debian gnu/linux i plan on fixing these in the
 not too distant future :) any comments and/or questions you may find me
 (nick: emss) at irc.freenode.net in #ratpoison
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version: 0.06.2
  rpvd.sh should now be POSIX compliant (maybe?)
  no longer dependent on bash
  uses POSIX Bourne/SH, POSIX awk, and ratpoison
 
 Description: Ratpoison virtual desktop(s)?
  Manages ratpoison groups and the frame layouts for those groups
  rpvd.sh is capable of saving and restoring groups and frame layouts
  For help on how to utilize rpvd.sh, run 'sh rpvd.sh -h'

 Please let me know if you find any bugs, or have any
 + ideas or suggestions on ways to improve rpvd.sh
 
 Would be nice to know if anyone actually uses this script,
 + besides myself of course :)

 You may find me (nick: emss) at irc.freenode.net in #ratpoison

 Thanks, and have a wonderful day :)

 rpvd.sh is now 515 lines, MD5 (rpvd.sh) = a68112a5b630bf130a714b5d4e21c9a4
