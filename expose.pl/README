Duplicates OS-X 10.3's Expose' functionality for ratpoison.
You should apply the TWBPatch or reverse the logic at line 43.

Perl script which tiles all open windows next to each other and allows to select one of them. Think OS X's expos√©.

Todo:
  Update to use current fdump format.
  Rewrite in CL or scsh.

  Due to e-mail obfuscation, line 46 should be:

  my $ret = join(", ", &rp_split(\@xids, \&split, $n, \@r));

  instead of what's on the file. -- [[buu?]]
