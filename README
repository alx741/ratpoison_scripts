Many of these scripts contain original errors and
errors of transcription by me.  Fix, expand, fork.
Be ruthless!

The collection of ratpoison scripts hosted at
http://ratpoison.wxcvbn.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/Scripts

To quote that page:
       Extensions to ratpoison in scripts or colon-commands.
       A good script should be:
           Useful.
           Portable.
           Clear and concise.
       If you can't figure out how to do what you want to do by calling
       existing programs, perhaps your idea would be better implemented
       as one or several Patches, or by writing a new program.
       
Notes
---
- A few groups of scripts try to accomplish the same
  thing in the same way.  They should be combined
  into a single script.

- Some "scripts" are bundled as .tar.gz archives.  I
  don't know enough to untar them and organize them
  as proper directories.  Please feel free to do so.

- lost subdirectory
  - These scripts may have disappeared forever.

- obsolete subdirectory
  - scripts marked obsolete in the wiki

- deprecated subdirectory
  - scripts marked deprecated in the wiki

- not_a_script_as_such
  - These files contain the makings of a script that
    should be transformed into a working script or
    just lists of instructions and other weirdness.

- Each script has its own subdirectory containing the
  collection of scripts and a README.  Feel free to
  reorganize it.

- Errors (please fix any and all and submit your commit!)
  Always refer to the original at
  http://ratpoison.wxcvbn.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/Scripts to
  see the author's original intent.
  - Fetching these scripts may have introduced spurious initial
    spaces including at the #! line at the top and other
    strange results of downloading over http
  - Many of these scripts were broken as they stood in the wiki.
  - Some author attributions may be missing.
  - "Updated date" from the wiki is not in the README for any of
     them.
