Yet another volume control script that makes use of amixer and bar

Script written by Igneous, used for changing alsa volume with the use of amixer, then displaying a visual percentage bar in ratpoison's bar with the use of dbar. This may need to be modified to work with your alsa setup. I only have a single sound card, its master control is called "Master", wave/pcm volume control is called "PCM". If yours are named differently, you'll likely need to change those values below.

Here's an example of my bindings. This would set alt+1-0 to be 10%-100% (Master), ` being 0%. ctrl+1-0 would be 10%-100% (PCM), ` being 0%. Alt+-/= is increment/decrease Master by 5%.. Ctrl+-/= is increment/decrease PCM by 5%:
