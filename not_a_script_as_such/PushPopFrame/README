Push and pop frames (using fdump/frestore) to a stack.

Add to your .ratpoisonrc

    alias pushframe exec ratpoison -c fdump >> /tmp/ratpoisonframes

    alias popframe exec ratpoison -c "frestore `tail -n 1 /tmp/ratpoisonframes`" && head -n -1 /tmp/ratpoisonframes | cat | cat > /tmp/ratpoisonframes

Works like you would think.
